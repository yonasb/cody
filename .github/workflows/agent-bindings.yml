# It's OK to disable this CI check if it's causing problems because the
# JetBrains client team can manually update and maintain the bindings
# until we fix the automation. This automation should NOT be blocking
# you from making progress on critical work.
# Please post in #wg-cody-agent to share feedback about this CI check.
