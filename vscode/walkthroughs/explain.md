Use Cody to get an in-depth explanation of any piece of code in any programming language.

To get started: select code in your editor, right click, and choose "Cody â†’ Explain Code".

You can also run this command from the [Cody: Commands Menu](command:cody.menu.commands), which has the default keyboard shortcut of `Option` `C` on macOS and `Alt` `C` on Windows & Linux.

<br>â€¢ Cody can also explain errors too, with the "Ask Cody to Explain" option in the ðŸ’¡ menus, or by right clicking on any items in the "Problems" tab of VS Code.
<br>â€¢ You can define your own custom code explain commands to suit, such as prompt that requests an explanation focused on potential security issues, using [Custom Commands (Beta)](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/cody/custom-commands).
